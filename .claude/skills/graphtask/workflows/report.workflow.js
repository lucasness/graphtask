// Example report-generation workflow for graphtask (E16, over the E15 universal
// schema). PARAMETERIZED by the target graph; the required args are `gid` +
// `base` (so the read stages can curl what the graph already holds), with
// optional `focus` (narrow the report to a sub-question / cluster) and
// `audience` (tune voice — "exec", "engineer", "newcomer"). Run it from a
// session that has the Workflow tool:
//
//   Workflow({ scriptPath: ".../report.workflow.js",
//              args: { gid: "<graph id>", base: "https://graphtask.wafers.live",
//                      focus: "…" /* optional */, audience: "…" /* optional */ } })
//
// CONTRACT (see the skill's "Using graphtask with dynamic workflows"): this
// workflow COMPUTES and RETURNS the finished report markdown + metadata. It is
// READ-OVER-GRAPH, WRITE-ONCE-BESIDE-IT. Contrast the research workflow, which
// is write-amplifying: it returns {nodes,edges} for the main loop to POST the
// /batch endpoint, writing INTO the graph. This one writes NOTHING into the
// graph — no report node, no tasks, no edges, no /batch. It RETURNS
// {title, description, markdown, source_graph_version, coverage}; the MAIN LOOP
// does the single side-effect: one idempotent PUT /api/graphs/:gid/report with
// Authorization: Bearer $GRAPHTASK_AGENT_TOKEN (a write-gated upsert; the PUT
// replaces the one report per graph). Workflow scripts can't curl; the agents
// inside them can — but ONLY the read endpoints (GET /graph, GET /tasks/:id,
// the read-gated POST /search|/context|/frontier|/inconsistencies). No agent
// here ever curls a write.
//
// INLINE FAST-PATH / DEGRADE: this fan-out only earns its token cost on a LARGE
// or multi-cluster graph. Always do the cheap GET /graph first for the node
// count N and theme count. For a TINY graph (N ≲ 35 AND ≲ 6 themes AND bodies
// ≲ ~40-50k tokens) SKIP this workflow: one search+traverse read → draft the
// whole report in a single inline pass → the main loop does the one PUT.
// Escalate to this workflow only when N ≳ 40, or bodies ≳ ~50k tokens, or ≳ 6
// themes/components — structure overrides raw count. Default to inline; agents
// cost tokens. If the Workflow tool is absent, degrade to the same single-agent
// sequential shape (map → draft → stitch → self-check → return) without the
// fan-out.
//
// Shape: index/read (one agent) → outline (one agent) → draft sections in
// parallel (blind drafters, each grounded strictly in fetched bodies) →
// deterministic stitch (frontmatter + concat, no agent) → completeness critic
// with a bounded re-draft, then RETURN.

// Citation convention. Drafters cite NODES with a stable [[cite:<id>]] marker
// instead of spelling out ("Title," #id) or pasting URLs/paths; the reader turns
// those markers into small numbered footnotes (hover shows the node, click opens
// it). Clean markers are what make the footnote system work.
const CITE = `CITATIONS — IMPORTANT: when you reference a graph node in prose, cite it with a marker [[cite:<numeric node id>]] placed immediately after the claim it supports — e.g. "PF is a load-capacity problem, not a balance problem[[cite:3171]]." Do NOT spell the node's title or "#id" out inline as prose (write "loading beats balance[[cite:3171]]", NOT 'the node "PF is a load problem" (#3171)'). Never paste raw URLs or file paths, and never invent a citation. For an external source (paper, guideline), cite its type:reference node's id. Multiple sources back to back: [[cite:3171]][[cite:3200]]. These markers render as small numbered footnotes, so keep them clean.
EDGE FIDELITY — edges are DIRECTED (source → target). Before prose like "A supports B" or "A contradicts B", confirm the live edge really runs A→B with that purpose; "A is supported by B" requires the edge B→A. Never inverted. And never upgrade a plain "related to" edge into an evidence or causal claim ("X supports Y", "Y exists because of X") — "related to" licenses only loose-association language ("loosely related", "connected to"). The E16.16 faithfulness judges verify both against the live edge list, so an inversion or causal upgrade is a caught defect, not a style choice.`;
