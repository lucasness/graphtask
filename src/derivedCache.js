// E18.1 STEP 5 — process-local memo for graph states reconstructed from the
// event log.
//
// WHY A CACHE IS SOUND AT ALL. `seq` is allocated by `gt_next_seq()` under the
// graphs-row lock, held to commit, so the visible prefix is GAPLESS and
// commit-ordered. That makes "the state of graph G after event seq N" a value
// that can never change: no event can ever be inserted into the middle of an
// already-observed prefix. A pinned (graph, seq) is therefore genuinely
// immutable, which is also why `?asOfSeq=` is the one read on this surface that
// gets a real `Cache-Control: max-age` instead of `no-store`.
//
// WHY THE KEY IS `${graphId}:${seq}` AND NEVER `seq` ALONE. `tests/setup.js`
// runs `TRUNCATE ... RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE` before EVERY test while this
// module's state survives for the whole file. A seq-only key would hand test 2
// the answer it computed for test 1 — the two graphs both start their log at
// seq 1. The graph id is part of the identity of the value, not decoration.
//
// Ships `_resetDerivedCacheForTests()`: the house rule for any process-level
// singleton (src/auth/index.js:39, `_resetAdapterCacheForTests`).
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHY THE BUDGET IS BYTES AND NOT ENTRIES
//
// This cache used to hold a fixed 256 ENTRIES, on the theory that a folded
// state is "kilobytes per graph, not megabytes". That is false on real data.
// Measured against the production clone (65 graphs, 4103 tasks, 7664 edges):
// the largest graph's state is 1175 nodes + 2289 edges = 748 KB of JSON and
// retains 1.28 MB of heap. 256 of those is ~330 MB — and it is reachable from
// a plain read endpoint, by walking `?asOfSeq=` down one big graph's log.
// Measured: RSS 57.8 MB -> 399.6 MB over 256 such reads, heap 6.1 -> 295.8 MB,
// on a box with under 3 GB. So the cap has to be on SIZE.
//
// THE PROXY. `JSON.stringify(entry).length` is what is counted. Measured across
// the clone's eight busiest graphs, retained heap is 1.6x-2.1x that number —
// a tight, faithful ratio — whereas a node+edge COUNT proxy ignores exactly the
// thing that varies (long `meta.description` strings) and is what made the
// original estimate wrong in the first place. It costs 4.7 ms on the largest
// production entry against an 87 ms cache MISS (canonicalJson would cost 32 ms
// for the same number; byte-equal, since canonicalisation only reorders keys),
// so it is paid only on the miss that just did far more work.
//
// THE NUMBERS. 16 MiB of counted JSON is ~27-34 MB of retained heap at the
// measured ratio. Per graph: a quarter of that, and at most 16 entries, so one
// big graph scrubbing a timeline slider cannot evict every other graph or own
// the whole budget. MAX_ENTRIES stays as a belt-and-braces ceiling for the
// opposite shape — a flood of tiny states, which cost Map overhead the byte
// count does not see.
