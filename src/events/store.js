// E18.1 STEP 5 — graph(t): reconstruct `GET /graph` at any point on either
// clock, from the append-only log.
//
// This module owns the SQL side of the reconstruction (which base to start
// from, which events to replay, in which order). The fold itself is pure and
// lives in src/events/fold.js. Nothing here imports src/db.js: the pool is an
// argument, which keeps the module unit-testable and keeps the DATABASE_URL
// read-once rule (src/db.js) out of its import graph.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE TWO CLOCKS
//
// `learned_at` is BELIEF time — when we were told. It is stamped by the
// database with clock_timestamp() and accepted from nowhere.
// `happened_at` is WORLD time — when the thing was true. Callers may backdate
// it, and the row triggers flag `payload.backdated` when they do.
//
// LEARNED AXIS (the default) answers "what did the graph look like in our
// records at time T". Because `gt_next_seq()` allocates `seq` under the
// graphs-row lock held to commit, the visible prefix is gapless and
// commit-ordered, so `learned_at` is monotone with `seq` within a graph.
// Two consequences this file leans on hard:
//   * `ORDER BY seq` IS learned order. No `(learned_at, seq)` composite, no
//     settled-horizon hack, no lagging visibility window.
//   * `learned_at <= T` selects exactly the PREFIX `seq <= maxSeq(T)`. So an
//     asOf timestamp can be resolved to a single seq up front, and everything
//     downstream — including the cache key — is a seq.
//
// HAPPENED AXIS answers "what was the world like at time T, as far as we can
// tell". It re-sorts the log by `happened_at`, which is a DIFFERENT order, so
// last-writer-wins produces a DIFFERENT answer. That divergence is the signal.
// This module must not reconcile it.
//
// WHY A PERIODIC SNAPSHOT CANNOT BE A HAPPENED-AXIS BASE. A snapshot at seq S
// encodes "every event with seq <= S, applied in LEARNED order". A backdated
// event learned after S sorts BEFORE some of those on the happened axis, so
// S's last-writer outcomes are simply wrong for that ordering. Genesis is the
// one exemption: it is a substrate, not a fold of events, and each of its rows
// carries its own `created_at`, so it can be filtered honestly by birth time
// (`filterGenesisByHappened`).
//
// WHY `?axis=happened` REQUIRES `asOf`. A seq is a handle on BELIEF time. There
// is no such thing as "the happened-axis state at seq 42".
