# E13.10 memory-safety guard (#436 / 3GB box). The graphtask server sits at ~2GB
# once the ONNX model warms, so a burst of /search|/context can OOM it (signal:
# killed). Use this to (a) verify the endpoint, (b) restart via the gateway mgmt
# API if it's down (NEVER /stop — that 502s the live site), (c) optionally restart
# to FREE the warm model before agent-heavy phases that don't need it.
#   ensure-up.sh check        -> exit 0 if /api/config 200, else restart + wait
#   ensure-up.sh fresh        -> force a restart (drops the 2GB model) + wait healthy
