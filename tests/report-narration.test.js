// E16.17 — the drafter self-talk (process narration) guard, both halves.
//
// Section drafters in report.workflow.js return their final message as the
// section markdown, so any process narration they emit ("All grounding
// fetched... Drafting the section now.") ships verbatim into the published
// report. Observed live on 2026-07-09: 8 leaked lines across two generated
// reports. The guard is (a) a hardened drafter prompt, (b) a deterministic
// scrub in stitch(), and (c) a detector in the eval scorer so the faithfulness
// gate catches whatever both miss.
//
// report.workflow.js is NOT importable (top-level return + injected globals —
// see report-workflow.test.js), so the workflow half is asserted statically
// as text, and the regex is kept in sync with the eval's exported twin.
